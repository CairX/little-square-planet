		<h1>Prototype: Unity</h1>
		<p>2017-03-26</p>
		<h2>Iteration 1</h2>
		<p><a href="iteration1.zip">Unity Executable</a></p>
		<h3>What Works</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Watching the seeds grow, because it is satisfying visual feedback of progress</li>
			<li>Different blooming patterns, because you can express yourself</li>
			<li>Competitive clicking, because self-imposed time-pressure makes it a game (not our aim)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What's Lacking</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>No reward, because it feels pointless</li>
			<li>No sense of persistence, because progress is lost on exit</li>
			<li>Avatar, because you feel like a world-overlord rather than a world-participant (immersion)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Proposed Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Seamless tiles, because visible grid breaks the illusion of choice</li>
			<li>Encapsulated island, because the current version feels endless and thus constrained</li>
			<li>Increased growth time, because a short growth time turns the game into a race</li>
			<li>Keyboard instead of mouse, because it feels more immersive with an avatar</li>
			<li>Counter, because no feedback makes everything feel pointless</li>
			<li>Inventory/economy, to create a purpose and show progress</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Iteration 2</h2>
		<p><a href="iteration2.zip">Unity Executable</a></p>
		<h3>Result of Changes</h3>
		<h4>Seamless Tiles</h4>
		<p>The change made the borders invisible, which made placement of seeds difficult. Thus, we want to be able to see the borders, but have them be discrete.</p>
		<h4>Encapsulated Island</h4>
		<p>It works because it distinguishes the planting area.</p>
		<h4>Increased Growth Time</h4>
		<p>It is still too short for the intended game. For testing purposes, it is adequate, but requires more testing with an exposed variable.</p>
		<h4>Counter/Economy</h4>
		<p>Creates a sense of progression.</p>
		<h4>Keyboard Instead of Mouse</h4>
		<p>Was never implemented.</p>

		<h3>What Works</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The sense of progression</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What Could Progress Lead to?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>More types of seeds</li>
			<li>Upgrades, e.g. expanded area, research, faster growth, more yield, buildings, decorations</li>
			<li>Story transmissions reacting to player choices</li>
			<li>Robot commentary reacting to player choices รก la "Bastion"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Proposed Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>No punsihment for mistakes -> undo plant/button</li>
			<li>Changing cursor is annoying, because it makes it harder to see which pixel is clickable -> static cursor with a context-sensitive side icon</li>
		</ul>
